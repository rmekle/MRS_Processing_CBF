% getCoilELement_from_SiemensDICOM_s.m
%
%% Function to obtain number of a coil element from the DICOM header of a file generated 
%  on a Siemens MRI/NMR scanner 
%  using functions from the MRS processing toolkit FID-A
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% USAGE
% [coil_element, coil_string, info] = getCoilELement_from_SiemensDICOM_s(fullFilename_NMR, displaySwitch);
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% Extract information about the coil elment, with which a DICOM image was acquired on a   
% Siemens MRI scanner. 
% 
% INPUTS:
% fullFilename_NMR	= String variable for the full filename (i.e. full path of filename) 
%					  of the DICOM file generated on a Siemens MRI/NMR scanner
% displaySwitch		= Switch to display outputs; 1 = ON, 0 = OFF
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% coil_element      = Number of coil element, with which DICOM input file was acquired on
%						a Siemens MRI/NMR scanner, if images of individual coil elements
%						were saved; empty, if DICOM file is a combined NMR data file
% coil_string		= String that contains information about RF coil or coil element, with
%					  which NMR data file was acquired:
%					  equal to # of coil element or
%					  equal to 'X', if input DICOM file was combined MR image or
%					  empty (''), if input DICOM file was combined MRS data
% info				= struct that contains the metadata from the compliant DICOM or DICOS 
%					  file specified as MRS input data file obtained using the Matlab
%					  routine dicominfo plus a .csa field that is a struct that contains 
%					  values from the 'SIEMENS CSA HEADER' private group in a DICOM file 
%					  produced by a Siemens MR scanner
