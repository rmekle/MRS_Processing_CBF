%% Calculate tissue volume coefficients for partial volume correction in MRS, if desired
% Assumptions:	
% - All data files are consecutively sorted, e.g. by date
% - List of rda files, NIFTI files, and segmented tissue volumes are named and sorted in a
% coherent fashion, i.e. the first rda file in the list of rda files corresponds to the
% first NIfTI file in the list of NIfTI files, etc.

% Each calculation of partial tissue volume coefficients requires one rda file for
% obtaining the coordinates of the volume of interest (VOI)/voxel, a NIfTI file of
% T1-weighted images that were used for placement of the VOI and for segmentation, and for
% each segmented tissue a tissue volume file

% Here, for actual calculation the python routine pvoxel3.py is used
% Usage: pvoxel3.py [-d] [-w] [-e T1.nii] [-m maskSource.nii] [-r offsetRead]  [-p offsetPhase]  [-s offsetSlice]  spect.rda compartment1.nii ...
%       -w          winner mode, for each pixel the winning compartment takes it all
%       -d          debug mode: print names, create additional files called highLight...nii, for testing purpose
%       -m          copies maskSource.nii to a file with prefix "mask_" which is 1.0 inside and 0.0 outside of voxel
%       -l          display first highLight file, for testing purpose
%       -e T1.nii   geo info of T1.ni is applied to all compartment.nii
% Output: overlap of spect.rda's voxel with each compartment.nii.
% Options -w and -l exclude each other in the sense that the highlight files to be created
% for displying using option '-l' are not created when using option '-w'
