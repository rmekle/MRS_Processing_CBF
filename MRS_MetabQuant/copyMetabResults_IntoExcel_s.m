%% Function to copy results from metabolite quantification of MRS data into MS Excel 
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% USAGE
% [resultsTable_final] = copyMetabResults_IntoExcel_s(fullFileName_In,noLastRowsToDel,bDeleteCols,indColsToDel,bMoveCols,noColsToMove,newColsTable,strOutDir,fileExcel,strSheet,strRange,bWriteVariableNames,bUseTemplate,fullPath_Template);
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% Function that reads in results from metabolite quantification from a (.csv) file into a
% table, adds additional elements (columns) provided as input to table, reorders and saves
% final table to Excel file.
% If (Excel) template is provided, output is written to formatted Excel file.
% 
% INPUTS:
% fullFileName_In	= String variable for the full filename (path) to the (.csv) file
%						that contains the original results from metabolite quantification
% noLastRowsToDel	= Integer, # of last rows to be deleted from original table of results
% bDeleteCols		= Boolean that specifies whether to delete columns from original table
%						of results
% indColsToDel		= Indices of columns to be deleted from original table of results
% bMoveCols			= Boolean that specifies whether to move columns during reordering of 
%						new table
% noColsToMove		= integer, # of colums to be moved during reordering of new table
% newColsTable		= Integer, # of columns to be added to original table of results
% strOutDir			= String variable for the name of the output directory, i.e. the 
%						directory, where all output files are saved to
% fileExcel			= string variable, filename for output Excel file
% strSheet			= String variable that specifies name of sheet in Excel file, 
%						to which final table of results is saved/copied to
% strRange			= String variable that specifies range of fields or starting field on
%						sheet in Excel file, 
%						to which final table of results is saved/copied to
% bWriteVariableNames = Boolean that specifies whether variable names for data in table
%						are also written to spreadsheet in Excel
% bUseTemplate		= Boolean that specifies whether a (Excel) template file is copied to 
%					 
% fullPath_Template	= (Optional) String variable for full path of (Excel) template file
%						Default is '', an empty string assuming no template is used.
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% resultsTable_final = Final table of results from metabolite qunatification
%						(initial table of results plus modifications)
