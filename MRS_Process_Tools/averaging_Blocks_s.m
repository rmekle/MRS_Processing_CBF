% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% Average blocks of averages in a scan by adding the averages together and then 
% dividing by the number of averages in one block
% 
% INPUTS:
% in			= Input data in matlab structure format
% blockSize		= Size of blocks (i.e. # of averages in one block) used for averaging
%
% OUTPUTS:
% out			= Output in matlab structure format after averaging of blocks of data
